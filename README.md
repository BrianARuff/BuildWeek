# Build Week: Project Description

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past 4 weeks and apply them in a concrete project. The Objectives of this project are:

- Allow each student to demonstrate their proficiency across the objectives thus far learned at Lambda School.
- Prepare each student in their respective section to develop a firm understanding of how Lambda Labs operates.
- Provide students with as many opportunities as possible to learn what it's like to develop software in a real world environment.
- Provide students time to develop at least 5 projects worthy of professional portfolio during their time at Lambda School.
- Encourage cross section and cross course collaboration amongst our student body.

## Web Foundations Role Description

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past 4 weeks and apply them in a concrete project. The `Web Foundations` Unit explored the following topics: `User Interfaces 1 - 3`, `Git for Web Development`, `Responsive Design 1 - 2`, `Pre-Processors 1 - 2`, `JavaScript Fundamentals 1 - 4`, `DOM 1 - 2` & `Components 1 - 2`. For your project this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the week. Your primary role and responsibilities will revolve around the items mentioned above. You will use those skills to be responsible for the general, overall layout of this project, the styling and aesthetics of this project and the users abilities to interact with content in a user friendly way are primary responsibilities for you as a UI Developer. Work closely with the Web Application developer to ensure that you are able to work with the JSX syntax, and where to add your style sheets.

## Web Application Development Role Description

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past 4 weeks and apply them in a concrete project.

The `Back End Development` unit explored the following topics: `Building RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js`, `Server-side Routing`, `Express Middleware`, `Deployment and Good Practices`, `Introduction to Relational Databases and SQL`, `Inserting and Modifying Data`, `Querying Data, Migrations and Seeding`, `Introduction to Data Modeling`, `Introduction to Authentication`, `Using Sessions and Cookies`, `Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)`, `Client Side Authentication`, `Introduction to Automated Testing`, `Testing React Applications`, `Testing Web APIs`. For your project this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a group of students cross section to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) over the course of the week. Your primary role and responsibilities will revolve around the items mentioned above. You will use those skills to be responsible for the back-end architecture of this project. You will work closely with your Front End Architect in order to discover project needs and deliver working Endpoints for your application.

## Instructions

Focus on the objectives and desirable outcomes of Build Week listed in the description of this document above. You're aim here is to deliver a product and to work in roles across the development life-cycle of your application.

- **Team communication and collaboratoin are keys to success here**.
- Lean heavily on your PM and your team for support and exercise the 20 minute rule.
- Develop a git branching strategy and commit work-flow early on and commit your code often.
- You will be graded on this assignment. Pay attention to the Rubrics by which you will be graded in order to effectively utilize the skills you have learned thus far.

### Daily Schedule

The following is a loose schedule for you to abide by while building your projects. Day 0 and Day 5 are the only days that are set in stone. The rest of the week is up to you how you get things accomplished.

#### Day 0 - Kick off

The Friday before you start building this project you will be organized into a team and your goal is to make a few key decisions. All of the follow needs to be done by 5pm on Friday. You need to have a plan moving into the weekend and starting on the following Monday. The following need to be **completed by the end of the day on Friday:**

- [ ] Pick a project from the list of project ideas provided to you.
- [ ] Head over to a few sites to draw inspiration for the theme of your project. [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) & [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) come to mind.
- [ ] Create a Github Repository and add each team member and your PM as collaborators on the project.

#### Day 1 - Build Day

- [ ] By the end of day: Your front and back end should be deployed and communicating with one another.
- [ ] A deep focus on getting the project rolling understanding team roles, development processes such as: Git merge conflicts, branching strategies and code documentation should begin to be ironed out.

#### Day 2 - Build Day

- [ ] Build!

#### Day 3 - Build Day

- [ ] Build!

#### Day 4 - Build Day - Final Day of Coding

- [ ] Feature freeze by 11AM PST. NO MORE NEW FEATURES BUILT. Today is all about polish and presentation.
- [ ]

#### Day 5 - Demo and Review

- [ ] Deliver a live 3 min Demo of your project.
- [ ] Meet with your PM to recieve a review of your participation for the project.
